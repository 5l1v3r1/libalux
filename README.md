# Abstract

[Alux](https://github.com/unixpickle/alux) is my Hobby Operating System. It will include a suite of system calls and APIs, but will leave most higher-level tasks to the user-space software. The purpose of **libalux** is to provide a simple C++ API for interacting with the kernel API. In particular, it will abstract the CPU-specific syscall mechanism. Additionally, it will provide various utilities and functions for your convenience.
